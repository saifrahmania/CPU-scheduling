Saifur uses facebook almost all the time. He was wondering what are Friends of Friends in facebook ? If “X” is his friend, and “Y” is X’s friend but “Y” is not his friend, then “Y” is called his friend of friend. You have to find how many friends of friends Bob has. (Assume each user in facebook has a unique 4-digit ID number). First line contains a integer “N” (1&lt;=N&lt;=100) the number of friends in Saifur's Profile. Then follow N lines.  First Integer in each line is the ID number of Raj's friend, then an integer “M” (1&lt;=M&lt;=100) is the number of people in his friend list. Then follow M integers in that line, denoting the ID number of friends in his friend list (excluding Saifur).
